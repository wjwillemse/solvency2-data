Usage
=====

To use solvency2-data in a project::

    import solvency2_data

After installation you can use the functions in the package in for example a Jupyter notebook.

To get the term structures per 31/12/2017 enter

:: 

	d = solvency2_data.read("2017-12-31")


If you do not add a input datetime, i.e. solvency2_data.read(), then the function will use today() and you will receive the most recent published term structure.

This returns a Python dictionary with all the information about the term structures. The dictionary has the following keys

* *input_date*: the original date by which the function was called is stored in the dictionary as input_date

* *reference_date*: the proper reference date generated from the input date. The reference date is the most recent end of the month prior to the input date. So if for example the input is datetime(2018, 1, 1) then the reference date is '20171231', because this the most recent end of the month prior to the input date. The reference date is a string because it is used in the name of the files to be downloaded from the EIOPA-website.

* *url*: the url of the term structures

* *name_zipfile*: the name of the zip-file 

* *name_excelfile*: the name of the Excel-file contained in the zip-file that was downloaded

* *meta*: the information per term structure contained in the Excel-file: the Coupon frequency, the Last Liquid Point, the Convergence period, the Ultimate Forward Rate, the alpha parameter of the Smith-Wilson algorithm, the Credit Rate Adjustment and the Volatility adjustment

* *RFR_spot_no_VA*: the term structures without Volatility adjustment (a Pandas DataFrame)

* *RFR_spot_with_VA*: the term structures with Volatility adjustment (a Pandas DataFrame)

You can get the term structure without Volatility adjustment for the Euro by 

::

	rates = d['RFR_spot_no_VA']['Euro']

This returns a Pandas Series (convert it to a Numpy array to use it in calculations).

The package also contains the Smith-Wilson algorithm that is used to derive the original term structures published by EIOPA. You can use this algorithm to derive term structures with alternative extrapolation by changing the parameters. 

For this you can do the following. First define the liquid maturities of the term structure, together with a Python dictionary of rates. Then use the smith_wilson function.

::

	liquid_maturities = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20]
	rates = d['RFR_spot_no_VA']['Euro']
	ratesin = {num: float(rates[num]) for num in liquid_maturities}

	alt_curve = smith_wilson(liquid_maturities = liquid_maturities,
             				 RatesIn = ratesin, 
             	 			 nrofcoup = d['metadata'].loc[:, 'Euro'].Coupon_freq, 
             	 			 cra = 0,
             	 			 ufr = 0,
             	 			 T2  = d['metadata'].loc[:, 'Euro'].LLP + 
                     			   d['metadata'].loc[:, 'Euro'].Convergence)

In this case, we use a UFR of zero and a CRA of zero.

Configuration file
------------------

The solvency2-data.cfg specifies the directories where the downloaded zip-files and the Excel files are stored. The .cfg file can be stored in the directory from where the code is run, otherwise the .cfg file in the package directory is used.
